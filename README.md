# Perfeggt - Cooking Time Calculator

![Info Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcelJurtz/Perfeggt/master/assets/banner.png)

Boil perfect eggs using scientific methods! The application uses Charles D. H. Williams' formula to calculate the perfect cooking time.

By specifying the weight of the ice (in grams, alternatively by the size factors S, M, L or XL), the temperature of the ice, the desired consistency and the current height above sea level, the perfect duration your egg needs is calculated.

After you have started the cooking process, an alarm automatically reminds you when the cooking time has been reached.
